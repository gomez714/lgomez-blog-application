# World of Gomez (WIP)

This is a simple blog I built to learn how to use gatsby and give myself a place to express myself.

Currently it is populated with posts from [Learn with Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/) to show functionality, but I will be populating with personal posts as soon as I accomplish my desired layout.
